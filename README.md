# DStudio


## How to run ? 

```
git clone https://github.com/harshu4/DStudio.git
cd DStudio
python3 -m http.server 

```


DStudio = Decentralize + Studio

## Brainstorm 🧠

Creating a friendly and usable product for everyone. There is a huge demand for survey and product testing and we believe
with decentralize workforce this demand can be met. We decided to create a drag and drop interface for the effect network so that
users can build forms for various use case


## Infrastructure 🏗

We are build to be resilient. Our infrastructure is designed very carefully keeping in mind the amount of effort and time players from all around the world will spend on our platform. We use OKEX chain for providing base level security in logics and causing no single point of failure. For faster curation of data we use SubGraphs. We have deployed our own subgraph node for hosting the platform. Audio chat is done via Webrtc. Utmost care is taken in designing the infrastructure to be as decentralized as possible. IPFS is used as a decentralize storage to store all images.

We have build on Effect-Network SDK and added a drag and drop support to build forms and various other things 

## What it does 🔧

The possible usage for the DStudio is upto the user we have created it to be as generalized as possible
we have provided various features such as 
- Rich Text Editor 
- Drag and Drop Form Builder 

This can be used for 

- Survey Forms 
- Q/A Forms 
- Task Giving Forms


## Challenges we ran into 💪
The biggest problem for a metaverse builder is creating sustainable code to for the future generation to built on thinking modularly was one of the toughest thing to do


## Accomplishments that we're proud of 😎
Totally Modular code fully working demo deployed on EffectNetwork Testnet. 

## What's next for Dstudio ⏱

There’s a lot to build and lot to learn.
- Adding more batches after creating template
- Integrating Repetitions once EffectNetwork launches it
- Auditing for Security
